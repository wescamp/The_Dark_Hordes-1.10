This is a profile list for characters in The Dark Hordes. It has two purposes: providing some exposition for players and possible future maintainers, and serving as a guide for any possible future portrait artists.

1. Main characters
---------------------------------------

1.1
Gwiti Ha'atel

Not your average necromancer. Gwiti and his brother Nati both killed themselves in an arcane ritual and sacrificed their souls to quickly gain more power than any normal practitioner of necromancy can hope to achieve, though they still look human and living. Both wear rather elaborate costumes, which is especially noticeable on the lower levels, as initiates are generally clothed in rags. Gwiti's clothing emphasises the colour red, though this is a result of team colour and can be changed to another if needed.

1.2
Tanar

Chieftain of a clan of orcs, Tanar is more intelligent and thoughtful than most orcish warriors. Driven from their home by relentless dwarvish assaults (who, unknown to the orcs, are themselves fleeing from their former homes), Tanar runs into Gwiti. They join forces to eradicate the dwarves.
